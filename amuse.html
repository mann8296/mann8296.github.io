        <h1>Amusement :-)</h1>
        <p>Here are some links that amuse me, and that I hope amuse you, as well. ;)</p>
        
        <h2>Blingee.com</h2>
        <p>Blingee is a website that anyone can use to make little animated PNGs, adding cosmetic touches like glitter text or animated confetti. It was very<br> popular with tweens around the MySpace era, but has since seen a return to popularity among young adults today.</p>
        <p><strong>↓ Here's an example of a 'Blingee'! ↓</strong></p>

        <h2>Homestarrunner.com</h2>
        <p>The pinnacle of 2000s flash animated content, Homestar Runner made waves in cyberspace when it first debuted in the year 2000. It was, and still is, <br> loved by many for its sharp wit and iconic characters, like the eponymous Homestar Runner himself.</p>
        <p>When software company Adobe announced they were shutting off support for Flash in all browsers at the end of 2020, many worried that<br> it would be the end of this iconic website. However, with a little technological know-how and a lot of elbow grease, the website managed to see it through to this very day.</p>

        <h2>Taskbah.com</h2>
        <p>Now, this one's kinda odd, and I can't explain it very well without giving away the joke. I encourage you to click the link and experience it for<br> yourself. All I can really say its a dorky pun on an iconic 80s hit. ;)</p>
