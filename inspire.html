  <p>Yo mama, also known as your mother, was a reknowned bio-physicist, notable for her studies on gravitational pull using the mass of her fat rolls.</p>
  <p>She sadly passed away in the handicapped bathroom in the 7/11 off I-25, after choking on a dozen dongs at the same time. May she rest in peace.</p>
