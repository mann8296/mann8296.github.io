  <h2>Why He's Inspiring</h2>
  <p>Stephen Hillenburg was a marine biologist, animator, and writer born in 1961 in Oklahoma. Having a fascination with the ocean since a young age, Hillenburg<br> eventually became a professor at the Orange County Marine Institute, in part using comics to educate his students.</p>
  <p>He contributed to the world of televised animation by working on the show <cite>Rocko's Modern Life</cite>, and creating his own show <br><cite>Spongebob Squarepants</cite>, which became one of the biggest cartoons of the 90s and 2000s.</p>
  <p>In 2017, he was unfortunately diagnosed with ALS, but despite his illness, he continued to work and contribute to the animation industry.<br>He passed a year later, in 2018.</p><br>
  
  <p>The fact that he used his cartooning skills to help him educate his students, as well as his strong attitude to continue working through illness, <br>makes him a very inspiring person to me.</p>
